🍴 Zomato Food Delivery Demand Estimation
📌 Project Overview

This project estimates the daily order volume for Zomato in India using a top-down modeling approach. Instead of relying on private company data, we combine publicly available information (population, smartphone penetration, urban tier splits, online food delivery adoption, order frequency) with business assumptions.

~~The objective is to:

1. Quantify the daily order demand (~4M orders/day)

2. Understand sensitivity to key levers (penetration, frequency, DAU%)

3. Highlight business implications for marketplaces

🔍 Methodology~

Population Base

India population: ~1.4B

Urban target market: ~500M

Digital Penetration

Smartphone penetration ~70%

Online food delivery penetration ~8–10%

User Behavior

DAU/MAU ~25–30%

Average order frequency: ~1.2 orders per DAU per day

📊 Results

Base Case: ~4M orders/day

Sensitivity Analysis:

Penetration ±10% → orders vary 3.6M – 4.4M

Frequency ±0.2 → orders vary 3.5M – 4.8M

📈 Business KPIs Framework

Defined key marketplace KPIs to interpret demand & supply:

Orders/day, AOV, GMV – for revenue planning

DAU/MAU, repeat rate – for customer retention

On-time %, cancellations, delivery time – for operations

Promo dependence – for marketing ROI

🖼️ Visualization

📌 One-pager dashboard (mockup in Figma/Excel/PowerPoint)

Shows: Orders/day estimate, urban-tier splits, weekend/festive uplift, sensitivity graph

(Add screenshot here of a clean 1-pager visualization you design, similar to Blinkit sales analysis format.)

🚀 Business Implications

Growth levers → drive penetration in Tier-2/3 cities

Operations → optimize delivery fleet sizing for weekends/festivals

Marketing → reduce promo dependence while improving retention
